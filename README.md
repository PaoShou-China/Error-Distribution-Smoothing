# EDS:Error Distribution Smoothing

**Paper Title:** Error Distribution Smoothing: Advancing Low-Dimensional Imbalanced Regression

This repository contains the code for four experiments related to EDS.
## Usage

- All experiment scripts are located in the `experiments/` folder.
- For each experiment, run the scripts in numerical order (e.g., `1.py`, `2.py`, ...).
- The results and output figures will be generated in the `results/` directory.

## Directory Structure

- `experiments/` — Experiment scripts for each task
- `results/` — Output result files and figures
- `src/` — Core algorithm implementations
    - `eds.py`: Code for the proposed method (EDS)
    - `SMOGN.py`: Code for the comparison sample management method (SMOGN)
- `data/processed/` — Generated and processed data used in experiments
- `data/` — Raw and processed data

For more details, please refer to the comments in each script.
